I feel it's important to be able to communicate in a non-technical well to justify solutions and challenges, working together to overcome any barriers.<\/p><p>Attention to detail, turning designs into pixel perfect websites.<\/p><p>Understanding problems and the ability to resolve them with efficient solutions. Whilst having the confidence to query anything that's unclear. <\/p><p>Acceptance that technology is always evolving, staying upto date with the latest languages and best practises.<\/p>"

              "answer": "<p>Organisation, planning and communication are key to me.<\/p><p>Where agile working is in place, I would use this to help prioritise. In my current role we have a weekly meeting with the project team where the Project Manager dictates the priorities, generally motivated by the client. We set deadlines and manage expectations.<\/p><p>At times I can face various demands, for example tickets from client services as well as new build projects. As a business we aim to decide priorities together but in reality, it can often be one PM against another. <\/p><p>To balance this I prioritise to ensure effective project management and successful outcomes. <\/p><p>Firstly, planning is essential. I  start by breaking down the ticket into manageable tasks, setting clear objectives, and establishing realistic timelines. This helps to prevent overwhelm and ensures that each aspect of the project receives adequate attention.<\/p><p>Regular updates with team members helps to keep everyone informed of progress, addressing any challenges or roadblocks promptly. <\/p><p>Furthermore, I believe in maintaining a flexible mindset. While it's important to adhere to the initial project plan, unexpected challenges or new priorities may arise. <\/p>"

It was great to see that Shopify have their own channel.<\/p><p>To keep more up to date with industry news I listen to podcasts like Syntax and Developer Tea.<\/p><p>I also love working as part of a dev team, I find it a great way to share knowledge, best practise and technology updates.<\/p>"

While the specific techniques may vary depending on the technology stack, I typically focus on several key strategies to achieve this goal.<\/p><p>Firstly, I streamline the website by optimising images, ensuring they are appropriately sized, and utilising lazy loading where possible.<\/p><p>Though my experience with caching is limited, I recognise its potential to enhance performance by storing frequently accessed resources.<\/p><p> Additionally, I aim to minimise API calls and database queries to reduce server response times.<\/p><p>In the past, I have used tools like Lighthouse to assess the performance of a site, enabling me to identify areas for improvement and implement necessary optimisations.<\/p>"

I find their knowledge valuable to avoid going down a rabbit hole, especially when working with new tech stacks where I don't fully understand the restrictions yet.<\/p><p>I'm a big fan of Notion so usually create a note with a list of To Dos, which makes the task less daunting. If I'm working on a new build \/ larger project I create a board to manage sub tasks.<\/p><p>Then I get to coding. I tend to start by fleshing out the basics; get my html structure, check data responses and add functionality. Once I'm happy with this I then get styling.<\/p>"
